# **How does Insiders Analytics work**

Thanks to their privileged position, **insiders may have access in advance to information that could impact a company stock price**. To enhance market fairness, **Insiders are required by law to timely report their transactions** to the SEC which in turn make them publicly available via the EDGAR system {3}.

The wealth of reports about insiders transactions collected and stored in EDGAR is astonishing. However, 


**[Insiders Analytics](https://twitter.com/insidersanalyt1) mines insiders reports and produces automated analyses based on the data extracted**. 

**The project mission is to contribute to market fairness** by disseminating structured information about insiders' transactions.
