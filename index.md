## Insiders and Insider Trading

**Insider** is a term describing a director or senior officer of a publicly traded company, as well as any person or entity, that beneficially **owns more than 10% of a company's voting shares** {1}. 

**Insiders may have access to privileged information** that has not been made available to the public and that could substantially impact the company's stock price of the company shares. Indeed, researchers have shown that insiders transaction may be predictive of future's stock performances{2}{3}{4}.

**It's illegal for insiders to buy and sell shares of their company's stock based on their privileged information**. For this reason, Insiders have to comply with strict disclosure requirements set by the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) with regard to the sale or purchase of the shares of their company {2}. 

## Mining the SEC databases to track insiders' behavior 

Corporate insiders are required to report their insider transactions within two business days from the date the transaction occurred and **their reports are collected and made publicly available via the SEC Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system (EDGAR)**{3}.

**[Insiders Analytics](https://twitter.com/insidersanalyt1) mines EDGAR's insiders reports and produces analyses based on this data**, thus contributing to the public dissemination of knowledge about insiders' transactions.
