# **Background**

## Insiders and Insider Trading

 ► An **insider** is any person or entity **owning more than 10% of a company's voting shares** {1}. 

 ► Thanks to their privileged position, **insiders may have access ahead of the public to information that could impact the company stock price**. 

 ► It's illegal for insiders to buy and sell shares based on their privileged information...however research shows that **insiders transactions can be predictive of stock performances** {2}{3}{4}.

## Mining the SEC databases to track insiders' behavior 

**Insiders are required by law to timely report their transactions** to the SEC which make them publicly available via the EDGAR system {3}.

**[Insiders Analytics](https://twitter.com/insidersanalyt1) mines insiders reports and produces automated analyses based on the data extracted**. 

**The project mission is to contribute to market fairness** by disseminating structured information about insiders' transactions.
