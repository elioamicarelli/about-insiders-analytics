# **How does Insiders Analytics work**

Thanks to their privileged position, **insiders may have access in advance to information that could impact a company stock price**. 

To enhance market fairness, **insiders are required by law to timely report their transactions** to the SEC which in turn makes them publicly available via the EDGAR system [5].

Unfortunately, these documents stay silent until the data they contain are systematically extracted, analyzed and presented to the general public. 

**[Insiders Analytics](https://twitter.com/insidersanalyt1) does exactly that! It mines insiders reports, produces analyses based on the data extracted, and delivers daily analytics directly to your Twitter feed**. ü§ñ üëÅÔ∏è üí∏
