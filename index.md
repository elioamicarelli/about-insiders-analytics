## Insiders: Who are they and why you should keep an eye on their transactions...

Insider is a term describing a director or senior officer of a publicly traded company, as well as any person or entity, that beneficially owns more than 10% of a company's voting shares {1}. 

Insiders may happen to have access to privileged information that has not been made available to the public and that could substantially impact the company's stock price of the company shares. 

It's illegal for insiders to buy and sell shares of their company's stock based on their privileged information. For this reason, Insiders have to comply with strict disclosure requirements set by the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) with regard to the sale or purchase of the shares of their company {2}.
